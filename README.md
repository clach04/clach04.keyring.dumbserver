# clach04.keyring.dumbserver

Insecure, terrible, [keyring backend](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) - similar to jaraco.keyring Remote Agent Keyring.. just way worse (but it is cross platform).
Similar intent to https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.keyring but just for a local machine over regular http (on a tcp socket, not a domain socket).

  * [DumbServer - keyring backend](#dumbserver---keyring-backend)
    + [dumbserver - web server](#dumbserver---web-server)
  * [Alternatives](#alternatives)

Current backends:

  * SimpleKeyring - can store only one password in memory, both service and username are **ignored**
  * DumbServer - Accesses local http server (currently hard coded)
      * a demo http only (no https support) server `dumbserver` is included which only listens to requests from local machine and only supports one password (both service and username are **ignored**) - this is unsafe on a shared machine, and probably unsafe in general ðŸ˜‰


## Getting Started

    python -m pip install keyring

Known to work with keyring 24.2.0 and Python 3.11

## Quick Demo

    python -m clach04.keyring.dumbserver prompt

enter in a test password, the server defaults to listening on port 4277 (override via os env `DUMB_SERVER_KEYRING_PORT` or `PORT`) then in another session (or web browser):

    curl http://127.0.0.1:4277/get

To see the password with web client.

To access password from keyring issue:

    python -m keyring -b clach04.keyring.DumbServer get testsvc testuser
    python -m keyring -b clach04.keyring.DumbServer get service ignored

To see the same password.

## SimpleKeyring - keyring backend

    python -m keyring -b clach04.keyring.SimpleKeyring get testsvc testuser

## DumbServer - keyring backend

`dumbserver` (and `DumbServer`) port can be controlled via operating system environment variable `DUMB_SERVER_KEYRING_PORT` or `PORT`.

    python -m clach04.keyring.dumbserver
    python -m keyring -b clach04.keyring.DumbServer get testsvc testuser

### dumbserver - web server

  * Only supports a single password, both service and username are **ignored**
  * Does NOT use keyring (could be updated to proxy onto a real Keyring backend)
  * Python 3 or Python 2
