# clach04.keyring.dumbserver

Insecure, terrible, keyring backend - similar to jaraco.keyring Remote Agent Keyring.. just way worse
Similar intent to https://github.com/jaraco/jaraco.keyring but just for a local machine over regular http (on a tcp socket, not a domain socket).

Current backends:

  * SimpleKeyring
